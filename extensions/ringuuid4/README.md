# RingUUID4

This ring extension contains one function only called (newuuid4) this function returns a new random UUID (version 4) whenever it's been called.

This library is a cross platform but I have built and tested it on Ubutnu only.

**Note:** building this library in Ubuntu requires installation of (uuid-dev) package

	sudo apt-get install uuid-dev

**Source C library:** is [this repo](https://github.com/johanlantz/uuid).

Have a nice time :)

Enjoy :)
